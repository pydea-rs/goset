# GoSet

GoSet is a basic implementation of a set data structure in Go. It provides fundamental set operations such as adding, removing, and checking for the existence of elements. This project is intended as a simple and efficient way to work with sets in Go, especially when you need a lightweight solution without external dependencies.

## Origin

The idea for GoSet originated from one of my previous projects, where I needed a set implementation and decided to extract and generalize the code for reuse. This repository contains the core functionality, making it easy to integrate into other Go projects.

## Status

This is a basic version of GoSet. Additional features and improvements are planned for future releases.

## Features

- Add elements to the set
- Remove elements from the set
- Check if an element exists in the set
- Retrieve the size of the set


## TODOs:
- Add pop/push
- Add some extra helping functions
